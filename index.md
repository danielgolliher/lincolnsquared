There's a whole neighborhood beyond Lincoln Center, and that neighborhood could use some extra attention.

Whether it's trash collection or simply networking neighbors, there's a lot to be done. 

That's what Lincoln Squared is for.

The first order of business: clear up trash alley (West End Avenue between 64th and 59th)!  

Stay tuned for posts and updates about this project and the broader neighborhood.
