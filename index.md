Hello, my name is Daniel. I live in Lincoln Square, and I pick up the trash on the blocks around my building. 

Specifically, along Trash Alley‚ÄîWest End Avenue between 64th and 59th.

A few times each week I clear the trash from the sidewalk and a Citi Bike station, and I recently adopted a trashcan through the Department of Sanitation. I wrote about how to do that [here](https://ilovetheupperwestside.com/adopt-your-own-litter-basket-child/).

## Support

The Department of Sanitation gives me free litter basket liners, but if you want to help me buy gloves and other items there's always Venmo.
