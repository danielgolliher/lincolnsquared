# About

Hello, my name is Daniel. I live in Lincoln Square in NYC, and I pick up trash on the blocks and Citi Bike station around my building. 

Specifically, along Trash Alley—West End Avenue between 64th and 59th.

I don't get paid to do it. I'm just a guy who loves his city and enjoys producing positive externalities.

I also adopted a trashcan in Trash Alley through the Department of Sanitation. When it gets to be about three-quarters full, I pull out the trash bag, tie it, and replace it. No more overflows on my watch, and for a <a href="https://twitter.com/danielgolliher/status/1490811183850573827?s=20&t=grki6xRPus7PSKOIzXDD0Q" target="_blank">remarkably negligible time commitment.</a> 💪 😤

Thousands of people live along Trash Alley, and about 10 of us could end litter basket overflows. Join me?

I wrote about how to do that <a href="https://ilovetheupperwestside.com/adopt-your-own-litter-basket-child/" target="_blank">here.</a>

# Support

The Department of Sanitation gives me free litter basket liners, but if you want to help me buy gloves and other items there's always Venmo.
