Equipment needed (get affiliate links?):
* 44 gallon durable black bag
* gloves
* hand sanitizer
* trash picker

Procedure:
* Be safe, watch for cars
* Don't pick up anything you don't want to pick up; this usually means things that are super big or wet
* When you've filled your bag, tie it up and leave it _next to_ a city trash can for collection.
* Take a picture and share!
