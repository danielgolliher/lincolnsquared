## Keeping NYC's Lincoln Square clean

Lincoln Squared began in early 2021 when Daniel (see below) got tired of seeing trash along his section of West End Avenue between 64th and 59th street, so he just started picking it up himself. It's amazing what one man can do in an hour! Throughout the year it became clear that the residents of the area needed a push to help their neighborhood; the trash problem got visibly worse, and no organization stepped up to combat it or put neighbors in touch with each other. 

Lincoln Squared is about the neighborhood beyond Lincoln Center, and it's about making it better for all of us.  

Stay tuned for posts and updates about this project and the broader neighborhood.  

## People

**Daniel Golliher** started Lincoln Squared in practice about a year ago, but started it officially in November 2021. It's a (for now) one-man civic response to the state of things. Daniel saw what a difference one person can make by just picking up trash for a few blocks and talking to people (you can truly improve the day of thousands of people, such an impact!), so he's seeing what else he can do. And maybe what he and his neighbors could do together.
